# Lucky Guess - Onchain Gambling Game

## Project Overview

**Lucky Guess** is a collection of simple onchain betting games built on the Dojo engine, leveraging Verifiable Random Functions (VRF) for provably fair gameplay. The platform is hosted at [luckyguess.gg](https://luckyguess.gg) and features multiple gambling games with a house edge system and player reward mechanisms.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Dojo Engine
- **Language**: Cairo
- **Blockchain**: Starknet
- **Randomness**: VRF (Verifiable Random Function)
- **Primary Token**: STRK (betting currency)
- **Reward Token**: GUESS (earned through gameplay)

## Game Portfolio

### 1. Coin Flip ðŸª™
- **Concept**: Players bet on heads or tails
- **Betting Token**: STRK
- **House Edge**: 45:55 probability (if player chooses heads, actual probability is 45% heads, 55% tails)
- **Mechanics**: Simple binary outcome with configurable bet amounts

### 2. Roulette ðŸŽ°
- **Concept**: Traditional roulette game
- **Status**: Planned
- **House Edge**: TBD (will follow similar model to coin flip)

### 3. High-Low Number Guessing ðŸ”¢
- **Concept**: Players guess if next number will be higher or lower
- **Status**: Planned
- **House Edge**: TBD (will follow similar model to coin flip)

### Future Games
- Additional games to be added based on player feedback and market demand
- Each game will maintain the house edge system for long-term profitability

## Tokenomics

### STRK (Betting Currency)
- Primary currency for placing bets across all games
- Standard Starknet token integration
- Direct betting and payout mechanism

### GUESS Token (Reward & Utility)
- **Earning**: Players earn GUESS tokens by playing games
- **Utility**: Purchase basis points to reduce house advantage
- **Mechanics**: 
  - Players can spend GUESS tokens to buy basis points
  - Basis points reduce house advantage for a specific number of bets
  - Creates a strategic layer where skilled/frequent players can improve their odds

## House Edge System

### Default House Edge
- **Coin Flip**: 45:55 probability split
- **Future Games**: Similar slight house advantage (exact percentages TBD)
- **Purpose**: Ensures long-term profitability while maintaining fair gameplay

### Dynamic House Edge Reduction
- Players can use GUESS tokens to purchase basis points
- Each basis point reduces house advantage slightly
- Reduction applies to a limited number of future bets
- Creates incentive for continued play and token accumulation

## Architecture Components

### Smart Contracts (Cairo/Dojo)

â”œâ”€â”€ lib.cairo                 # Main library
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ coin_flip.rs         # Coin flip game model
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mod.rs               # Models module

```

### Key Models
- **Player**: User account, balance, statistics
- **Game Session**: Individual game instances
- **Bet**: Bet amount, game type, outcome prediction
- **Token Balance**: STRK and GUESS token management
- **House Edge Modifier**: Basis point purchases and applications

### Key Systems
- **Betting System**: Handle bet placement and validation
- **VRF Integration**: Secure random number generation
- **Payout System**: Calculate and distribute winnings
- **Token Rewards**: GUESS token distribution logic
- **House Edge Management**: Apply and track advantage modifications

## Development Guidelines

### Game Addition Process
1. Define game rules and probability mechanics
2. Calculate appropriate house edge percentage
3. Implement game model in Cairo
4. Add game logic to actions system
5. Integrate with VRF for randomness
6. Add comprehensive tests
7. Update frontend interface

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each game type
- Integration tests for token interactions
- VRF randomness validation
- House edge probability verification
- End-to-end gameplay testing

### Deployment Configuration
- **Development**: `dojo_dev.toml`
- **Production**: `dojo_release.toml`
- **Torii**: `torii_dev.toml` for indexing

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams
1. **House Edge**: Guaranteed profit from probability advantage
2. **Transaction Fees**: Small fees on bet placement (optional)
3. **Premium Features**: Enhanced GUESS token utilities

### Player Incentives
1. **GUESS Token Rewards**: Earned through gameplay
2. **House Edge Reduction**: Strategic advantage for frequent players
3. **Progressive Features**: Unlockable content and games

## Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security
- Comprehensive testing of all game logic
- VRF integration validation
- Reentrancy protection
- Access control for administrative functions

### Fairness Guarantees
- VRF ensures provably fair randomness
- On-chain verification of all game outcomes
- Transparent house edge calculations
- Public audit trail of all bets and payouts
